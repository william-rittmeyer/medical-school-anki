# Tulane Medical School Anki Deck

LAST UPDATE: 9/13/23 7:40 a.m.

***LAST UPDATE INCLUDES LECTURES FROM TUESDAY 9/12/23*** 

Hello my friends, this is an Anki deck I will be preparing throughout the year.

***FOR ANATOMY USE THE OFFICIAL TULANE ANKI DECK***


I will continually update this deck. So that you do not need to import the whole deck every single time, I suggest importing only the packages that you do not have but I recently added. However, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THE ANKI CARDS I suggest importing the whole deck that is in the root folder.

 Below is a list of the lectures covered so far in the deck:

Phase 1:

  MSK-1

    Histology

      -Lecture 1: Nerve Tissue (9/12/23)

    Biochemistry

      -Lecture 1: Microtubules (9/11/23)
      -Lecture 2: ER-Golgi Trafficking (9/12/23)
      -Lecture 3: Actin Cytoskeleton (9/13/23)

    Physiology

      -Lecture 1: Membrane Potential (9/8/23)
      -Lecture 2: Action Potentials (9/11/23)
      -Lecture 3: Neuromuscular Junction and Other Synapses (9/13/23)
      -Lecture 4: Skeletal Muscle (9/14/23)

    Genetics


To download one must be on a computer (not mobile). Click the green button that says "code" then select "download zip" to download the deck.

-For Histology, I used the slides on eMedley to figure out what was relevant information and went to the book for additional information. Specifically, I used Junqueira's book which can be found on eMedley. I also utilized the study guide on eMedely.


-For Biochem, the reading he handed out is extremely helpful. I made cards primarily out of the material that was BOLDED (which I have been told is the most important info). If you are wondering where this reading material is, he sent an email about it and the packet can be picked up in Hutch. It is also on eMedley.


-For Anatomy, I will be using the OFFICIAL ANKI DECK that Tulane supplies.

-For Physiology I used the reading he provides as well as his slides.

-For Genetics, I will be using the slides and making cards out of those.
